# Supplementary Materials for *Curiosity and Attachment dominate dynamic visual attention allocation*

This repository contains the supplementary data, and materials used in the paper "Curiosity and Attachment dominate dynamic visual attention allocation" submitted to *Nature Human Behavior*. The provided resources are designed to allow replication and further exploration of the results presented in the paper.

## Repository Structure

- `attention_maps/` - Contains the attention maps for 30 stop points. This is the visual attention maps generated through eye-tracking of the participants.
- `meaning_maps/` - Contains the attention maps for 30 stop points. This was obtained by conducting experiments on 30 stop point images following the method of Henderson and Hayes[1]. 
- `attribute_maps/` - Contains the attribute maps for 30 stop points. It respectively contains three kinds of attribute maps related to the experimental task: danger, information, and environment.
- `viausl_saliency_maps/` - Contains the visual saliency maps for the 30 stop points. The GBVS algorithm published by Harel et al.[2] was used here.
For all the details of the maps, please refer to the Method section of the paper.
